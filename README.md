# Encrypt Bridge

A secure, encrypted cross-chain token synchronization framework built on Clarity for the Stacks blockchain, providing advanced cryptographic asset management and interoperability.

## Overview

Encrypt Bridge is a revolutionary blockchain infrastructure solution designed to facilitate secure, encrypted cross-chain token synchronization. By implementing advanced cryptographic techniques, our smart contract framework ensures safe and reliable token transfers between different blockchain networks, addressing critical challenges in cross-chain asset management.

## Architecture

The system consists of several sophisticated components:

### Token Vault (`token-vault`)
- Secure storage and management of tokenized assets
- Implements advanced encryption mechanisms
- Provides robust token state tracking and verification

### Sync Manager (`sync-manager`)
- Orchestrates cross-chain token synchronization
- Ensures cryptographically secure state consistency
- Implements complex synchronization protocols to prevent double-spending

### Access Control (`access-control`)
- Implements granular, role-based access management
- Provides multi-layered authentication and authorization
- Manages cryptographic key distribution and verification

### Event Log (`event-log`)
- Comprehensive, immutable event tracking system
- Generates transparent, encrypted audit trails
- Supports advanced event querying and forensic analysis

### Token Encryptor (`token-encryptor`)
- Provides advanced token encryption and decryption services
- Supports multiple encryption standards
- Enables secure token representation across different blockchain environments

## Key Features

- Secure token synchronization across contracts
- Comprehensive permission controls and authentication
- Event tracking and auditability
- Support for multiple token standards
- Flexible token representation mapping
- Robust error handling and validation

## Smart Contracts

### Token Registry
The central registry contract that manages token relationships:
```clarity
;; Register a new token
(register-token (token-id (string-ascii 64)) (name (string-utf8 64)) (token-type uint) 
                (original-contract principal) (metadata-uri (optional (string-utf8 256))))

;; Add token representation
(add-token-representation (token-id (string-ascii 64)) (contract-principal principal) 
                         (representation-id (string-ascii 64)))
```

### Encrypt Bridge: Secure Cross-Chain Token Synchronizationhronizer
Manages the synchronization of tokens across contracts:
```clarity
;; Configure token sync pair
(configure-token-sync-pair (primary-token (string-ascii 32)) (secondary-token (string-ascii 32)) 
                          (enabled bool) (conversion-rate uint))

;; Initiate synchronization
(initiate-sync (primary-token (string-ascii 32)) (secondary-token (string-ascii 32)) (amount uint))
```

### Authentication Manager
Handles permissions and access control:
```clarity
;; Register users and permissions
(register-user (user-principal principal) (permissions uint))

;; Check authentication
(check-auth (caller principal) (permission uint))
```

### Event Tracker
Records system events and provides audit trail:
```clarity
;; Record new event
(record-event (event-type uint) (token-id (optional uint)) 
              (target-contract (optional principal)) (details (optional (string-ascii 256))))

;; Query events
(get-events-by-token (token-id uint))
```

### Token Adapter
Provides standardized interface for token operations:
```clarity
;; Register token implementation
(register-token (token-id (string-ascii 32)) (contract-address principal) (token-type (string-ascii 10)))

;; Transfer tokens
(transfer (token-id (string-ascii 32)) (amount uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal))
```

## Security

The system implements multiple security measures:
- Comprehensive permission controls
- Authentication checks for all sensitive operations
- Event logging for audit trails
- Validation checks for all operations
- Protection against double-spending

## Usage

1. Register tokens in the Token Registry
2. Configure synchronization pairs in the Token Synchronizer
3. Set up permissions in the Authentication Manager
4. Use the Token Adapter to interact with different token implementations
5. Monitor operations through the Event Tracker

## Installation

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. Deploy the contracts in the following order:

1. access-control
2. token-vault
3. event-log
4. token-encryptor
5. sync-manager

## Development

Built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.
